The project I have chosen is Robotic Arm. I have seen several videos on YouTube in which a robotic arm perform various task and i was always fascinated by it. In general, I found robotics pretty interesting. In techkriti I have seen robotic dog and specially those robowars that further fuelled my interest towards robotics that's why I want to pursue robotics project this summer. In robotic arm i feel that I will get to learn more about how to link hardware part to software. 
Another project for which I did the task is GYROBOT(though I didnâ€™t fill it in preference but I found the task interesting). Gyrobot is pretty cool too. I think if I got it that will be fun making a self balancing robot. Along the semester I have attended several workshops organized by the club but due to prior constraint was not able to participate in ROBOTHON but looking forward to get a summer project under the club.
